--------------------------------------- JAVASCRIPT EXECUTION CONTEXT(JEC) ----------------------------------------------

Generally js exectuion context involves few steps for executing a js file.
1.Global Execution Context (GEC).
2.Meomory execution phase.
3.code exectuion phase.

1.GEC: 
> The Global Execution Context (GEC) is the default environment where JavaScript code runs.
> GEC has a global object (browser or Node.js). The this keyword refers to an object.
> this refers to one specific object, depending on the environment and context.

2.Memory execution phase:
> In the memory creation (execution) phase:
> Variables are set to undefined
> Functions are stored with their entire function definition
> Objects assigned to variables are undefined at first,Nothing is executed yet.

3.code exectuion phase:
> Code runs line by line.
> Variables get their actual values
> Objects are created and assigned
> Functions are executed when called
> New execution contexts are created for function calls.--> this means, when function gets called.. Again memory execution & code execution phases 
will be done to the each function.
>After the function finishes, its execution context is removed from the call stack.

-------------------------EX FOR JS EXECUTION CONTEXT--------------------------------------
let val1 = 10
let val2 = 5

function addnumbers(num1,num2){
    total num1 + num2
    return total
}

let result1 = addnumbers(val1,val2)
let result2 = addnumbers(10,8)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------CALL STACK------------------------------------------------------
> call stack works using LIFO(last in one out) method, it generally pop the top element from the stack or memory once its execution is
completed.
EXAMPLE:
        function first() {
  second();
}

function second() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

first();

steps of call stack working:

1.Global Execution Context is pushed to the call stack.--> this line means, The call stack begins with the Global Execution Context,
 and everything else runs on top of it.

2.first() is called → its execution context is pushed.

3.Inside first(), second() is called → its context is pushed.

4.second() runs and finishes → popped from stack.

5.first() finishes → popped.

6.At last only Global Context remains.
