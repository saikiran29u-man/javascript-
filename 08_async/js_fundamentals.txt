Define thread?
A thread is a worker inside a program that performs a specific sequence of tasks.
e.g: 
In a program that adds two numbers:
A thread takes the input values,
Performs the addition,
Produces the output.

All these steps are executed by the same thread in order.

--------------------------------------------------------

> JavaScript follows a single-threaded, synchronous execution model, which means new task only starts when previous one 
  gets completed.

> Asynchronous code: Asynchronous code is code that allows a program to start a task and continue executing other code 
  without waiting for that task to finish

> Blocking-code: is code that stops the execution of other code until it finishes its task.
  e.g:
    console.log("Start");

    for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) {} // slow task

    console.log("End");

> Non-Blocking code: is code that does not stop the execution of other code and allows JavaScript to continue running.
  e.g: 
    console.log("Start");

    setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Task done");
    }, 1000);

    console.log("End");

> webAPI: Web APIs are browser-provided tools that JavaScript uses to handle tasks like timers,DOM manipulation.
  ***A Web API is one type of API among many available APIs.***

  WHAT DOES WEBAPI DO?
  Web APIs take work off JavaScript’s hands, do it in the background, and notify JavaScript when it’s done.**
  
  NodeAPI: are APIs provided specifically for the Node.js runtime environment.

  WORKING OF Asynchronous CODE:

  callstack -> webAPI -> queues (task queue,microtask queue) -> eventloop

  *** All JavaScript execution happens in the Call Stack, but asynchronous tasks are handled outside it and later come back to it.***

  JavaScript starts by creating the Global Execution Context, which goes through a memory creation phase and a code execution phase. 
  The call stack executes synchronous code one step at a time. When JavaScript encounters asynchronous code,
  it sends it to Web APIs and continues executing synchronous code. After Web APIs complete their work,
  callbacks are placed into either the microtask queue or the task queue.
  The event loop monitors the call stack and, when it is empty,
  moves microtasks first and then tasks into the call stack for execution.
  Objects and data are stored in the memory heap during execution.
